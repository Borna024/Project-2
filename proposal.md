# Project 02: Acquisition Predictor
### by Borna Vahabzadeh, Cristian Smoger, Enrique Serizawa, and Roberto Cantu

## What:

Our team is creating a way to predict acquisition of companies by other companies by developing a model to spot trends in historical data of both news articles and financial data of acquired companies, leading up to, but not including, the acquisition. After acquiring the data, we will split the data into training and test sets to train and test our model.

## Why:

Simply, we see this as a valuable tool, if our model executes as we intend. Being able to predict acquisitions would help one be able to see what companies to pay closer attention to, and if they are a publicly traded company, you could explore whether or not to invest.
